# DnD_5e_Character_Generator
Python script to generate D&amp;D Characters (stats, gear, spells, class, race)

I have an AWS Lambda that runs the script. The link below bring back a random level 1 character, if you want a different level, just replace the number at the end of the link. Max level is 20.
